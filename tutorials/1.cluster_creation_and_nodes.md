## Creating a k8s cluster

### 1. Locally

There ar two popular options to install a kubernetes cluster locally for learning purposes.

- minikube
- kind ([quick start](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/))

I prefer `kind` over minikube because it uses Docker containers as Kubernetes nodes (lighter than minikube's VM), supports multi-node clusters out-of-the-box.

### 2. On Cloud

- GKE
- AWS K8s
- vultr

## Setup local cluster with kind

### 1. Install kind (**_copied from [quick start #installation](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation)_**)

- On Linux
  ```bash
  # For AMD64 / x86_64
  [ $(uname -m) = x86_64 ] && curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.27.0/kind-linux-amd64
  # For ARM64
  [ $(uname -m) = aarch64 ] && curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.27.0/kind-linux-arm64
  chmod +x ./kind
  sudo mv ./kind /usr/local/bin/kind
  ```
- On macOs
  ```bash
  # For Intel Macs
  [ $(uname -m) = x86_64 ] && curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.27.0/kind-darwin-amd64
  # For M1 / ARM Macs
  [ $(uname -m) = arm64 ] && curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.27.0/kind-darwin-arm64
  chmod +x ./kind
  mv ./kind /some-dir-in-your-PATH/kind
  ```
- On Windows in PowerShell:
  ```powershell
  curl.exe -Lo kind-windows-amd64.exe https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.27.0/kind-windows-amd64
  Move-Item .\kind-windows-amd64.exe c:\some-dir-in-your-PATH\kind.exe
  ```

### 2. Create clusters

Before you start creating clusters, make sure you have docker running on your machine. `kind (Kubernetes IN Docker)` runs as a docker container in your machine.

#### Create your first cluster

Run the following command to create your first cluster.

```bash
kind create cluster
```

The terminal should look like this if everything goes well after running this command.

```bash
Creating cluster "kind" ...
 ‚úì Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.32.2) üñº
 ‚úì Preparing nodes üì¶
 ‚úì Writing configuration üìú
 ‚úì Starting control-plane üïπÔ∏è
 ‚úì Installing CNI üîå
 ‚úì Installing StorageClass üíæ
Set kubectl context to "kind-kind"
You can now use your cluster with:

kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kind

Have a nice day! üëã
```

Now if you check your docker containers, you can find a container running named `kind-control-plane`. Lets delete the container and see what happens.

```bash
kind delete cluster
```

The `kind-controle-plane` container should be gone.The cluster we created had only one node.

#### Create a cluster with multiple nodes

Let's create another cluster with more than one node.

We will be creating a cluster with two worker node and a controle-plane node.So, lets create a yml file containing the cluster configuration.

- `clusters.yaml`

```yaml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
  - role: control-plane
  - role: worker
  - role: worker
```

Now run the following command to create a cluster according to the configuration defined in the yml file.

```bash
kind create cluster --config clusters.yaml --name multi-node-cluster
```

Now, if you run `docker ps` command or view the containers from the docker desktop app, you will be able to see 3 containers.One of them will be controle plane and the others will be workers.

## How to communicate with the clusters and manage them?

To interact with your Kubernetes cluster - whether creating resources, inspecting current state, or modifying configurations - you need a communication channel with the Kubernetes control plane. There are two primary methods: using the official `kubectl` command-line tool (recommended for daily operations) or directly working with the Kubernetes API (useful for understanding internal workings). This section explores both approaches, starting with the fundamental API layer that serves as the gateway to your cluster's brain.

### 1. Kubernetes API

`NB: This method is not recomended to use and probably you never use it while working with k8s.Almost no one does.But it's good to know how things works behind the scene.
`

**_"The Kubernetes API lets you query and manipulate the state of objects in Kubernetes. The core of Kubernetes' control plane is the API server and the HTTP API that it exposes."_** -- from the [offical doc](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/)

Let's run `docker ps` command again. If you look closely, you can see that the control-plane has ports mapped to the local machine.

![](/assets/images/clsuster_creation/containers.png)
Here you can see, the localhost 39501 port is mapped to the kluster port. Everytime we run the cluster, the port mapping will be different. Lets hit that port in localhost in our browser.

![](/assets/images/clsuster_creation/api.png)

It says 403 forbidden. Because we need some credentials to be able to successfully communicate with the k8s API.

The credentials are stored in a file.Let's open the `~/.kube/config` file and see what's inside.

```yml
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
  - cluster:
      certificate-authority-data: <base64 encoded data>
      server: https://127.0.0.1:40765
    name: kind-multi-node-cluster
contexts:
  - context:
      cluster: kind-multi-node-cluster
      user: kind-multi-node-cluster
    name: kind-multi-node-cluster
current-context: kind-multi-node-cluster
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
  - name: kind-multi-node-cluster
    user:
      client-certificate-data: <base64 encoded data>
      client-key-data: <base64 encoded data>
```

to be able to access the API, we need to decode the certificate data and use them on Postman.

```bash
echo "<client-certificate-data>" | base64 -d > client.crt
echo "<client-key-data>" | base64 -d > client.key
echo "<certificate-authority-data>" | base64 -d > ca.crt
```

Now, lets create a postman certificate from `file->settings->certificates->Add certificate`
![](/assets/images/clsuster_creation/certificate.png)

This time if we hit the `https://localhost:40765/api/v1/namespaces` endpoint from the postman, we will be able to see a nice response.

### 2. Kubectl

`kubectl` is the official command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with Kubernetes clusters. It serves as the primary tool for developers and operators to communicate with API Server, manage Resources etc.

Install `kubectl` following the [official doccumentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) and let's procced to the next section.

- Connect kubectl to the cluster by running:
```bash
kubectl cluster-info --context kind-multi-node-cluster
```

- run some basic commands to see info about your cluster
```bash
# View cluster information
kubectl cluster-info

# List all nodes in the cluster
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

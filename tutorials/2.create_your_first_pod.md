## What a Pod is?

**_"Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes."_** -- (Official doc)[https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/]

You can think of it like a Docker container (though not exactly the same - this comparison just helps for understanding). It has its own file system, networking namespace, and can contain multiple containers that share these resources.

## Create a single container pod.

### Image and container

Before we start creating pods, we need an `image` to run it as a `container`.

- Container is the technology for packaging an application along with its runtime dependencies. For example, Docker container.
- A container image represents binary data that encapsulates an application and all its software dependencies. Container images are executable software bundles that can run standalone and that make very well-defined assumptions about their runtime environment.

### Run a simple docker container from an image.

Lets take a simple docker image to create a container in docker. For this tutorial, we will be taking the `nginx` [image](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx) which is available in dockerhub.

Let's run it using the following command,

```bash
    docker run -p 8001:80 nginx
```

Make sure that you've docker running in your system before executing the command. Here, we're mapping our localhost 8001 port with the containers port 80 so that we can access it through localhost:8001.

If it's ran successfully, you can see output like the following.

```shell-session
➜  ~ docker run -p 8001:80 nginx

```

The image is not found locally.So, it downloaded it from dockerhub and created a container using it.Let's visit http://localhost:8001

Next, we will be doing the same thing in kubernetes.

### Create your first pod

Let's see if we have any pods running at this moment by running the following command.

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

it'll show an output like the following if we don't have any pods running

```console
➜  ~ kubectl get pods
No resources found in default namespace.

```

Now, we will create the same nginx container inside our a pod in kubernetes.

```bash
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --port=80
```

The output should be `pod/nginx created` and if we run the command to show our pods again, 

```console
➜  ~ kubectl get pods                         

NAME    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx   1/1     Running   0          69s
```
we'll be able to see that one nginx pod is in Running state.

Let's see the pod logs by running,
```bash
kubectl logs nginx
```

```console
➜  ~ kubectl logs nginx

```
It's similar to the docker container log. That means our pod is running the nginx container.

But, how can we access the pod now? Can we access the pod using localhost:80 or we will go to localhost:8001? 

The answer is, 'you can not access the pods like this.' We'll discuss about how to access it in another section.

For now, running the pod successfully is our goal and we achieved it. Let's describe the pod to see details info about it.

```bash
kubectl describe pods nginx
```

```console

```

Here, we will be able to find all the details info about the pod. Don't worry if you don't understand all of these. Just take a look at the  section `Node:             multi-node-cluster-worker/172.18.0.4`.Here we can see that the pod is running on our first node. Try to create some more pods by changing the pod name like `kubectl run nginx2 --image=nginx --port=80`. Then describe them and check the node they are running in.
